## Introduction

In this task, we learn about Makefiles, which are a powerful tool for automating the build process of a software project. Makefiles allow us to define rules and dependencies for compiling and linking our code, making it easier to manage complex projects.

## Getting Started

To get started with this task, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the Makefile in a text editor to view and modify the build rules.

## Usage

To build the project, simply run the `make` command in the project directory. This will execute the rules defined in the Makefile and compile the source code into an executable.

To clean the project and remove the generated files, run `make clean`.
